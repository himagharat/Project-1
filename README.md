When initially researching for this project, we wanted to find a topic that was relevant to the present day while also something we were genuinely interested in the results of the research and seeing if there was an increasing trend in wildfires.
According to FEMA, a wildfire is an unplanned fire that burns naturally (ready.gov). It is important to note that residential fires are not included in this data - this only accounts for wildland fires.


With the recent fires highlighted in the media and the talks of increased wildfires due to climate change, we wanted to see if wildland fires are actually increasing as much as we think they are.
Looking into these wildfires, we wanted to research based on historical, geographical, and financial trends to see if there are noticeable trends or effects.
For the project we decided to use data from the National Interagency Fire Center (NFIC), which is a governmental organization that supports and they organize and allocate emergency resources to different federal, state, and local government agencies, such as the National Park Service and Departments of Agriculture and Interior.
